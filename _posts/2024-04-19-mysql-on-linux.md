# Install MySQL on Linux

MySQL is one of the most popular open-source relational database management systems.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to install MySQL on Linux.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A Linux-based operating system
- A user account with sudo privileges

### Step 1: Update Package List

First, update the package list to ensure you have the latest information about available packages:

```sh
sudo apt update
```

### Step 2: Install MySQL Server

To install MySQL Server, run the following command:

```sh
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

During the installation process, you'll be prompted to set a root password for MySQL. Make sure to choose a strong password and keep it secure.

If you are not prompted to set a password, you can set it manually by running the following command:

```sh
sudo mysql
```

```sql
 ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_password';
```

## Secure MySQL Installation

MySQL comes with a script that helps you secure the installation. Run the following command to start the script:

```sh
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

The script will guide you through the process of securing your MySQL installation. You can choose to set a root password, remove anonymous users, disallow root login remotely, and remove the test database.

## Useful MySQL Commands

```sh
sudo systemctl start mysql
sudo systemctl stop mysql
sudo systemctl status mysql
```

## Verify MySQL Installation

To verify that MySQL is installed and running correctly, log in to the MySQL shell as the root user:

```sh
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

Enter the root password you set during the installation process. If you can log in without any errors, MySQL is installed and running correctly.

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed MySQL on your Linux system. You can now start using MySQL to create databases, tables, and manage your data.
